# CS546-Final-Project

Final Project Proposal - Online Travel Forum

Our idea is an online travel forum. Such a website is designed for users to look up potential places to visit, seeing what other users have to say on hot vacation spots, and maybe even find a few tips on the best activities to do when there. Users will be able to log into the website and create posts on places they have been to visit, describing the experience, and other users will be able to “like” or “dislike” posts. Users will be able to create discussion threads, search by different criteria, and view travel spots based on location.

Feature Sections: 
User will be able to create an account and subsequently log in with their chosen credentials
Core:
Main Page 
After login in, the user will see the latest post
There will also be a menu tab that allows users to check other types of posts 
Tips while Traveling 
This page will be dedicated to tips while traveling (i.e. travel hacks) 
What to do in…
This page will be sorted by state/region and will contain posts about places and attractions to visit while in that area
Rate the best place to visit 
Users will be able to post polls asking which is the best place to visit among the given choices 
Users would then be able to vote for the place they think is best 
Users will see the results of polls 
View individual posts 

Extra:   
Users will be able to upvote and downvote a thread or a thread reply (similar to Reddit)
Users will be able to sort posts by different criteria (e.g. most recent, most popular, etc.)
User will be able to select a location and will be able to see forum posts by other users with various recommendations for that location
User will be able to create a “discussion thread”
Users will be “notified” when they receive a reply on their discussion thread or post
